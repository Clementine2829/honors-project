### Network Intrusion Detection system using Artificial Intelligence (Machine learning)

The three machine learning algorithms that I created are Convolutional neural network, Deep Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine without using libraries. They are all build from scratch. The libraries used are for plotting graphs and those fancy stuff. 

Convolutional neural network - is a type of artificial neural network used in image recognition and processing that is specifically designed to process pixel data.

Deep Neural Network - a neural network with a certain level of complexity, a neural network with more than two layers. Deep neural networks use sophisticated mathematical modeling to process data in complex ways

Support Vector Machine -  are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression analysis
